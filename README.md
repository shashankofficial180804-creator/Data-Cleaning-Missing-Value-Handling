# Data-Cleaning-Missing-Value-Handling
This repository contains Task 2 of my AI &amp; ML internship, focused on data cleaning and missing value handling using Python. The project demonstrates identifying, visualizing, and imputing missing data, improving data quality, and preparing datasets for machine learning workflows.

## Objective
To clean and preprocess datasets by handling missing values using Python.

## Datasets Used
- House Prices Dataset
- Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded datasets
2. Identified missing values
3. Visualized missing data
4. Applied mean/median/mode imputation
5. Removed columns with high missing values
6. Validated cleaned datasets
7. Saved cleaned files

## Outcome
Improved data quality and prepared datasets for ML modeling.
